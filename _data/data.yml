          ● Shaped my team workflows, increasing the speed and quality of our deliveries
           by incorporating automation on most of our workflows and created documentation around them.

           using Ansible playbooks and minimizing human errors.
          ● Reduced the amount of time taken to update datasets for clients by half with
           automation around manual and repetitive workflow.
